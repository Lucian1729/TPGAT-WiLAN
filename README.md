# TPML-WLAN-GAT
Wi-Fi networks based on IEEE 802.11 standard are critical for supporting
demanding services like virtual reality, augmented reality, and the Internet
of Things (IoT) in densely connected environments. However, interference
severely impacts Wi-Fi performance in such deployments. Newer standards,
such as 802.11n/ac, introduce Channel Bonding (CB) to enhance network ca-
pacity, but optimal channel assignment in dense and dynamic environments
remains a complex challenge and the problem of interference is made worse due
to the usage of wider spectrum channels. Existing analytical or system models
for predicting Wi-Fi performance after changes like dynamic channel selection
with CB suffer from low accuracy or high computational costs. To address
this, we propose a data-driven approach using a Graph Attention Network
(GAT) model. By leveraging deployment topology and wireless interactions,
our approach accurately predicts Wi-Fi performance. This research provides
valuable insights for optimizing Wi-Fi performance in dense environments and
informs decision-making for network administrators and practitioners.
